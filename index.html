        <h2>Welcome to our site</h2>
        <p class="intro">Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first.This is a website that will provide you of various information related to agriculture. We have articles, images to know the tools and about plants and all. </p>

            <h3>Why did farming lead to larger populations?</h3>
            <p>Farming lead to larger populations for several reasons. First of all, farming provided a food source that was right at hand with no need to travel to hunt for food. This made people stay in one place instead of wandering, so people became less nomadic. Larger families are more manageable when people are living in one set area instead of traveling great distances to look for food. Secondly, farming provided a more steady source of food

            <h3>What are some ways farmers can transition from using chemical pesticides to organic pesticides? </h3>
            <p>Many farmers consider transitioning from chemical (or conventional) farming to organic farming. Organic farming can be both profitable and environmentally sustainable. To become an organic farmer in the US, there is a specific set of practices that farmers must follow to receive organic certification. One thing that farmers must do as organic farmers is use only pesticides that have been approved for use on organic crops.

            <h3>Who is the individual who extracts oil from seeds? </h3>
            <p>The process of removing oil from seeds depends in part on the nature of the activity. The word for extracting oil from seeds is "dehulling," and the machines used in the process are "dehullers." When extracting oil from some types of seeds, a press is used to crush the seed, thereby allowing the oils to seep out and be collected.
