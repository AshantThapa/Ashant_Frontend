# Frontend code architecture

Frontend code architecture contains resources folder where css, images and js folder are created and they store files like css and js. The images folder contains images that are stored for designing purpose. The main file starts from index.html where the user can have the option to login and register once they register they are admitted as user. The user can be admin by updating usertype in database. If the usertype is user it lauches user dashboard and if the usertype is admin, it lauches admin dashboard. The API used for frontend is to post the data, get the data, update the data and delete the data. It is not so complex and the API consumption is minimum.
